Introduction:
This project is a simple, graphics-based game inspired by Pac-Man, developed in C++ using <graphics.h>, <conio.h>, and <dos.h> libraries. It creates an interactive experience where a player character navigates a grid, avoiding a "ghost" character.

Objective:
The main goal was to apply basic graphics programming in C++ by creating a grid-based game simulation with player-controlled movement, obstacles, and a simple antagonist.

Key Components:
Main Setup: Initializes a 640x480 game window and displays a title screen.
Movement Functions: m_right, m_left, m_up, and m_down handle player movement, while ghost controls the ghostâ€™s actions.
Map Layout: grid and map define the game boundaries and layout.
User Input: Captures keyboard input to control the player character.
Future Improvements
To enhance gameplay, consider adding a scoring system, collision detection, obstacles, sound effects, and modern library compatibility (e.g., SFML or SDL).

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates fundamental graphics and game programming concepts in C++. It provides a foundation for future expansion, making it a solid learning experience in interactive graphics.

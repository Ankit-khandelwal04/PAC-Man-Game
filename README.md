## 🎮 Introduction

This project is a simple, graphics-based game inspired by **Pac-Man**, developed in **C++** using legacy libraries like `<graphics.h>`, `<conio.h>`, and `<dos.h>`.  
It offers an interactive experience where the player navigates a grid-based maze while avoiding a pursuing ghost character.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Practice fundamental 2D graphics programming in C++
- Build a playable mini-game using basic input and visual elements
- Simulate player movement, game boundaries, and a basic antagonist (ghost)

---

## 🧩 Key Components

- 🔧 **Main Setup:**  
  Initializes a `640x480` graphics window and displays the **title screen**.

- 🎮 **Player Movement:**  
  `m_right`, `m_left`, `m_up`, and `m_down` functions manage player direction and animation.

- 👻 **Ghost Logic:**  
  The `ghost()` function determines ghost movement behavior and reactions.

- 🗺️ **Game Map:**  
  The `grid` and `map` arrays define the static layout and boundaries of the play area.

- ⌨️ **User Input:**  
  Real-time keyboard controls using `getch()` for smooth and responsive input.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Here are a few possible enhancements to expand this game further:

- 💯 Scoring system for collecting points
- 🎯 Collision detection for player–ghost interaction
- 🧱 Add obstacles and collectible items
- 🔊 Integrate sound effects for movement and events
- 🔄 Port to modern graphics frameworks like **SFML** or **SDL** for better compatibility

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project is a fun and educational implementation of classic game mechanics using **legacy graphics in C++**.  
It offers a solid foundation for exploring **2D game development**, **event handling**, and **game logic design**, and can serve as a stepping stone toward more advanced game engines.
